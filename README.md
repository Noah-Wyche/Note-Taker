## Installation
To use this application simply visit this link to get started:

## Usage
This application is very intuitive and easy to use. After visiting the link the User will be brought to the main page of the application. From there click "Get Started" and the note page is loaded ready to be used. Users will enter a title for their note along with the note itself. As soon as something is typed, the user will be able to either save the note, or clear the field, represented by buttons at the top of the page. Clearing the field resets the note of anything typed out already, while saving the note adds it to a descending list on the left side of the screen. Saved notes can be clicked and opened back up, and they can be be deleted. Once deleted a note cannot be recovered.
